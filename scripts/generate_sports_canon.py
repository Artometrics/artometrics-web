        # Artometrics sports canon source plan

        This plan turns the Warriors/Giants model into a repeatable sports-report system:
        every article gets five charts, but each chart must answer a different editorial
        question: history, peer comparison, efficiency, pain/volatility, and identity.

        ## First canon batch

        1. `yankees-the-artometrics-of-baseballs-empire`
           - Theme: empire, expectation, payroll conversion.
           - Sources: Baseball Reference, Lahman, Retrosheet/Baseball Almanac, Forbes.
        2. `lakers-the-artometrics-of-basketball-glamour`
           - Theme: star cycles, glamour, recurring Finals access.
           - Sources: Basketball Reference, NBA history, Sports Reference.
        3. `cowboys-the-artometrics-of-americas-team`
           - Theme: brand value versus postseason conversion.
           - Sources: Pro Football Reference, NFL records, Forbes.

        ## Next canon batch

        4. `celtics-the-artometrics-of-institutional-winning`
           - Theme: inherited expectation, title density, modern access.
           - Sources: Basketball Reference, NBA history, Sports Reference.
        5. `dodgers-the-artometrics-of-baseballs-modern-machine`
           - Theme: high-floor contention, spending infrastructure, October conversion.
           - Sources: Baseball Reference, Lahman, payroll-rank summaries, Retrosheet/Baseball Almanac.
        6. `patriots-the-artometrics-of-the-system-dynasty`
           - Theme: system shock, Brady/Belichick discontinuity, brand after dynasty.
           - Sources: Pro Football Reference, NFL records, Forbes.

        ## Cross-report analysis batch

        7. `sports-dynasty-index-best-and-worst-conversion`
           - Theme: championship mass, conversion, brand/output gaps, fan pain.
           - Sources: Baseball/Basketball/Football/Hockey Reference, Forbes.
        8. `league-money-skill-and-star-systems`
           - Theme: league economics, salary rules, star leverage, event scarcity.
           - Sources: Forbes, Spotrac, major reference databases.
        9. `regional-sports-identity-map`
           - Theme: region-locked sports identity, market depth, drought and civic memory.
           - Sources: franchise histories, valuation summaries, public regional framing.

        ## Chart contract

        Each report receives:

        - Chart 1: historical spine (titles, wins, eras, or long-run trend)
        - Chart 2: peer comparison (where this subject sits against the field)
        - Chart 3: identity metric (what makes the subject culturally/statistically itself)
        - Chart 4: contradiction chart (money vs wins, brand vs output, talent vs conversion)
        - Chart 5: pain, gap, or frontier chart (what fans/professionals argue about)

        ## Scale-up order

        ### Batch 2b - NL West companion
        5b. `padres-the-artometrics-of-paying-for-october`
           - Theme: star payroll without ring conversion; expansion scarcity; pennant drought.
           - Sources: Baseball Reference, Lahman, payroll-rank summaries, Retrosheet/Baseball Almanac.
           - Cross-refs: Dodgers machine, Giants arc, sports dynasty index.
        5c. `padres-world-series-ownership-blueprint`
           - Theme: buyer memo — franchise capital, player assets, peer gaps, first-title operating plan.
           - Sources: Forbes valuations, Baseball Reference WAR, payroll markers, farm context.
           - Cross-refs: Padres paying-for-October, Dodgers machine, dynasty index, league money.

        - Soccer: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Liverpool, Bayern, PSG.

        ### Batch 6 - individual sports and games
        - Tennis: Serena, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic.
        - Golf/chess: Tiger, Magnus, Kasparov, Polgar.
        - Olympics: USA, China, Soviet/Russia, small-country medal efficiency.

        ## Editorial rule

        A chart is not included because it exists. A chart is included because it changes
        the conversation between an Artometrician and an expert fan.

        ## Cross-reference rule

        Team profiles should now point to at least one cross-report benchmark:
        dynasty index, league economics, or regional identity. This makes the sports
        canon feel like one connected atlas rather than isolated one-off posts.
