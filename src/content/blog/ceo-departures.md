<p class="art-p art-lede">In 9,423 TidyTuesday CEO-departure records, median max tenure ceodb is <strong>1.00</strong> year and the ceiling is <strong>4.00</strong>. "Interim" appears in <strong>218</strong> rows—the dominant succession label—while company-level leaders reach <strong>2.0–2.5</strong> years at most.</p>
<p class="art-p">The median of 1.00 sets the baseline: many coded departure spells are short. The data ask which companies show longer max tenures, how interim versus co-CEO labels differ, and whether tenure fields move together.</p>

<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2021-04-27 (departures.csv). After cleaning, 9,423 rows remain.</p>
<p class="art-p">Max tenure ceodb is the primary ranked metric. Interim/co-CEO spelling variants appear as separate categories and reflect label noise as well as structure. Charts are Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks.</p>

<p class="art-p">Stewart Information Services and Conversant Inc lead at <strong>2.50</strong> on max tenure ceodb. A second tier—Avatex, Intrepid Potash, Bergen Brunswig, SEACOR, Micro Warehouse, RH—clusters at <strong>2.00</strong>.</p>
<p class="art-p">Relative to the file median of 1.00, even these leaders are only modestly longer spells. Extended CEO tenure is the exception, not the rule.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Conversant Inc appears at <strong>2.50</strong>, and the median among the top dozen is <strong>2.00</strong>. There is no long tail of decade-scale max tenures in this ranking metric.</p>
<p class="art-p">Cite 2.00 as the elite-club median for max tenure ceodb—double the overall median, still short of popular narratives about imperial CEOs.</p>

<p class="art-p">Interim accounts for <strong>218</strong> observations with a median max tenure of <strong>1.0</strong> and a mean near <strong>1.23</strong>. CO-CEO shows <strong>85</strong> rows with the same median of 1.0 but a slightly higher mean of approximately <strong>1.4</strong>. Smaller capitalization variants are tiny samples.</p>
<p class="art-p">The file is thick with interim spells—a succession-system fact: many departures pass through temporary authority before a permanent appointment.</p>

<p class="art-p">Category labels do not produce a dramatic tenure hierarchy. The larger pattern is the volume of spells coded interim.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Max tenure ceodb versus tenure no ceodb, colored by interim/co-CEO label, largely follows a tight correspondence—points hug aligned values, especially in the interim cloud (n=218).</p>
<p class="art-p">Where the two tenure fields disagree, coding definitions matter more than boardroom narrative. The scatter is a consistency check on the file's tenure construction.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Tenure fields are database constructions, not calendar biographies. Spelling variants of co-CEO fragment categories. Firm name changes and dual-class structures can split identities.</p>
<p class="art-p">A median of 1.00 may reflect coding granularity as much as calendar instability. Read the metric definition before converting it into a headline.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">In 9,423 departure records, max tenure ceodb centers at 1.00, with company-level leaders reaching only 2.0–2.5. Interim is the dominant succession label.</p>
<p class="art-p">The institutional story: departure files are full of short and interim spells, not a catalog of decades-long reigns.</p>
