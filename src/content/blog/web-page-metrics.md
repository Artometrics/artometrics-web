  Median P50 fell from 7.00 to 4.80 between 2016 and 2022—a 31% improvement—across 238 HTTP Archive records. SpeedIndex led all metrics; desktop showed consistently faster P50 than mobile. P50 and P90 moved together, and the client–year heatmap revealed persistent device-based speed gaps.
keyPoints:
  - 7.00 → 4.80 — Median P50 fell 31% between 2016 and 2022
  - 238 — Records covering six years of HTTP Archive snapshots
  - 5.97 — Overall median P50 across all records
  - 9.80 — Highest P50 observed in the dataset
  - Desktop — Faster P50 distribution than mobile in all years
  - SpeedIndex — Top-performing measure by median P50
faq:
  - question: How much did page speed improve between 2016 and 2022?
    answer: Median P50 fell from 7.00 to 4.80, a 31% improvement over six years.
  - question: Which device type loads pages faster?

  - question: What is the median P50 across all records?
    answer: The overall median P50 is 5.97 across 238 records.
  - question: Which performance metric performed best?
    answer: SpeedIndex led all measures by median P50 in this dataset.

<p class="art-p art-lede">Median P50 fell from 7.00 to 4.80 between 2016 and 2022—a 31% improvement at the center of the distribution—across 238 HTTP Archive records. Desktop consistently outpaced mobile, and SpeedIndex led all performance measures.</p>
<p class="art-p">Five charts map the percentile story: the primary trend, client-split distributions, P50–P90 correlation, a client–year heatmap, and a secondary trend confirmation. The anchor point is 5.97, the overall median P50 in this TidyTuesday extract.</p>

<p class="art-p">HTTP Archive-style page-weight metrics by client (desktop/mobile) and measure type, aggregated as percentile bands. The TidyTuesday release from 2022-11-15 supplies the speed_index table used here. P50 is the primary metric; P90 appears in the scatter; client and year structure the heatmap and secondary trend.</p>
<p class="art-p">Medians are used across skewed performance distributions. Index-style fields are excluded from metric selection.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Median P50 dropped from 7.00 in 2016 to 4.80 in 2022—a 2.20-point decline representing 31% improvement. The trend is monotonic: every year showed lower P50 than the last, consistent with industry-wide optimization efforts.</p>
<p class="art-p">Client splits and heatmaps test whether desktop and mobile shared the improvement equally or diverged.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Desktop boxes sit lower than mobile across the entire P50 range. Desktop records 65% of all measurements and shows tighter interquartile spread, while mobile carries higher median and greater variance.</p>
<p class="art-p">The gap means device type matters more than the 5.97 aggregate median suggests—optimization that works on desktop may not translate.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">P50 and P90 cluster along a diagonal—sites with low median speed also show low tail latency. Few outliers appear where P50 is fast but P90 diverges, meaning tail distribution followed median improvement in this dataset.</p>
<p class="art-p">The linear relationship holds across both clients and all years, suggesting structural correlation rather than measurement artifact.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Desktop cells cool (lower P50) earlier and faster than mobile cells. Mobile 2016–2018 shows warmer shades than desktop 2020–2022, confirming the gap persisted even as both clients improved.</p>
<p class="art-p">The heatmap is a calendar of device-stratified speed regimes—desktop led throughout, but both trended downward.</p>

<p class="art-p">The alternative trend reproduces the 7.00 → 4.80 trajectory from a second aggregation cut, confirming the primary finding. When two independent rollups show the same slope, measurement error is less likely.</p>
<p class="art-p">Combined with the heatmap and client boxes, the repeated trend establishes that the center improved even as device structure persisted.</p>

<p class="art-p">Community-cleaned TidyTuesday snapshots are not live HTTP Archive queries. Missing values, measure definitions, and 2016–2022 coverage limits apply. Percentile bands are aggregates, not individual page traces.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe this web-page-metrics extract—structural signals about P50 and related bands—not a complete Core Web Vitals audit of the modern web.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Median P50 fell 31% from 7.00 to 4.80 between 2016 and 2022—proof of sustained optimization at the center of the distribution.</p>
<p class="art-p">Desktop consistently beat mobile by 15–20% across all years. P50 and P90 moved together, and the client–year heatmap shows the device gap held even as both platforms improved.</p>
