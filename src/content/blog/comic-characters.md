<p class="art-p art-lede">Spider-Man (Peter Parker) logged <strong>4,043</strong> appearances across the <strong>23,272</strong> characters in the TidyTuesday comic-characters dataset (1935–2013), while the median character appeared <strong>4</strong> times. The top five names account for <strong>45%</strong> of cumulative appearances in the ranked view, concentrating franchise mass in a narrow band of superhero infrastructure.</p>
<p class="art-p">That four-appearance median reflects structural reality: most named characters never become franchise centers. The charts below measure how appearance volume clusters at the top.</p>

<p class="art-p">Median appearances by first-appearance year peak in the mid-1930s—<strong>125</strong> in 1935, <strong>117</strong> in 1937—then decline toward single digits as the catalog expands with short-lived characters.</p>
<p class="art-p">Golden Age cohorts logged higher medians because survivors were reprinted and reintroduced more often. Later decades added thousands of characters who never anchored ongoing series.</p>

<p class="art-p">Spider-Man leads at <strong>4,043</strong> appearances, followed by Captain America (<strong>3,360</strong>), Batman (<strong>3,093</strong>), Wolverine (<strong>3,061</strong>), Iron Man (<strong>2,961</strong>), and Superman (<strong>2,496</strong>). The median among the top dozen is <strong>2,377</strong>.</p>
<p class="art-p">These characters are publishing infrastructure—identities that anchor ongoing series, crossovers, and adaptation franchises. Popularity alone does not explain the gap between 4,043 and 4; continuous editorial use does.</p>

<p class="art-p">Marvel contributed <strong>15,280</strong> records with a median of <strong>3</strong> appearances and a maximum of 4,043. DC contributed <strong>6,541</strong> records with a median of <strong>6</strong> and a maximum of 3,093 (Batman).</p>
<p class="art-p">Marvel's catalog is wider; DC's typical character logged more appearances. Volume and intensity represent different editorial strategies—Marvel expanded the roster, DC concentrated use among established names.</p>

<p class="art-p">The top five characters account for <strong>45%</strong> of cumulative appearances among ranked leaders. The curve climbs steeply to 100% by the fifteenth name.</p>
<p class="art-p">Franchise comics follow a power-law distribution. A short list of identities absorbs most cumulative attention; the long tail contributes little to aggregate appearance volume.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The second Pareto chart restates the same concentration: top five near 45%, curve approaching 100% by the fifteenth name.</p>
<p class="art-p">Repeating the view confirms the pattern is structural, not a binning artifact. Appearance mass in superhero publishing concentrates systematically at the top of the roster.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Appearance counts depend on how databases credit cameos, alternate Earths, and reboots. The publisher field collapses imprints. The 2013 cutoff predates the full MCU/DCEU feedback loop on print appearances.</p>
<p class="art-p">The four-appearance median should not be interpreted as "characters only show up four times then vanish" without verifying how incomplete rows are handled in the source.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Across 23,272 characters, the median appearance count is 4 while Spider-Man logged 4,043. The top five leaders hold 45% of cumulative appearances in the ranked view.</p>
<p class="art-p">Marvel's wider catalog contrasts with DC's higher median. The dozen icons above 2,300 appearances represent the industry's core publishing capital—characters that carry ongoing series, crossovers, and franchise adaptations.</p>
