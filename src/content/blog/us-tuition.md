  Median state tuition rose from $5,876 in 2004 to $9,141 in 2015—a 56% increase—while Vermont led the nation at $13,486. The top decile began at $11,204, and five states accounted for 38% of aggregate tuition value across 600 state-year observations.

  - 38% — Share of aggregate tuition value held by the top five states
  - 600 — State-year observations spanning 50 states and 12 years

<p class="art-p art-lede">Median state tuition rose from $5,876 in 2004 to $9,141 in 2015—a 56% increase—across 600 state-year observations. Vermont led at $13,486, the top decile began at $11,204, and five states held 38% of aggregate tuition value.</p>
<p class="art-p">The median of $7,607 anchors the distribution. Vermont's lead, the climb from baseline to close, and the $11,204 top-decile threshold all measure distance from that center.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2018-04-02 (R for Data Science community). The working file contains 600 rows and 3 columns after merging available tables. Value is the tuition metric; state is the entity axis; year spans 2004–2015.</p>
<p class="art-p">Medians are preferred for skewed price distributions. The file reports a mean of $7,899 against the median of $7,607—relatively close, confirming modest skew.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Median tuition rose from $5,876 in 2004 to $9,141 in 2015. The typical state moved upward across the period, and no year showed a reversal.</p>
<p class="art-p">A rising median signals shared experience. High-cost states amplify the climb; low-cost states still participate in the upward shift.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Vermont leads at $13,486; the median among the top dozen states is $10,850. New Hampshire ranks second in the fact-box summary; the leaders chart shows the full numeric ladder.</p>
<p class="art-p">The gap from first place to the top-dozen median confirms a competitive but elevated upper tier—expensive relative to the file median of $7,607.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Median $7,607 versus mean $7,899—the distribution is relatively symmetric for a price series. The top decile begins at $11,204; high-tuition states occupy that upper slice.</p>
<p class="art-p">Near-symmetry at the center does not erase the expensive tail. It confirms the typical state is not distorted by extreme outliers in the average.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Leader trajectories diverge—some states fade while others surge. Tracking medians over time separates sustained high-price states from one-off spikes.</p>
<p class="art-p">Side-by-side paths matter when the policy question is whether expensive states stay expensive or the ladder reshuffles.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The top five state entries account for 38% of aggregate tuition value. Concentration is meaningful without being absolute: a visible head and a broader set of states carrying most of the remaining total.</p>
<p class="art-p">Pareto steepness reminds us that national tuition debates often orbit a minority of high-cost states even when the median tells a quieter story.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">TidyTuesday snapshots are not live College Board or IPEDS APIs. Missing values, state naming variants, and 2004–2015 coverage limits apply. Tuition definitions follow the source file's value field.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe this extract—structural signals about state price levels and trends—not net-price analysis after aid.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">State tuition rose from $5,876 to $9,141 at the median, centered on $7,607, with an expensive tail beginning at $11,204 in the top decile.</p>
<p class="art-p">Vermont led at $13,486, five states held 38% of aggregate value, and leader trajectories diverged—a price map of public higher education's mid-2000s to mid-2010s climb.</p>
