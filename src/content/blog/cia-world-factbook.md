  259 countries in the CIA World Factbook extract show a median population of 5,220,371 while China reaches 1,355,692,576. The top five countries account for 72% of aggregate population. High birth rates cluster among smaller nations, not demographic giants.
keyPoints:
  - 259 — Factbook entries with complete population data
  - 5,220,371 — Median population; mean is 32,294,361 due to right skew
  - 72% — Aggregate population share held by the top five countries
  - Zero correlation — High birth rates appear in small countries, not population leaders

<p class="art-p art-lede">China's 1,355,692,576 people sit against a global median of 5,220,371 in the CIA World Factbook extract — a 260-fold gap that drives every concentration metric. The top five countries hold 72% of aggregate population; most nations operate at a scale closer to the median than to the summit.</p>
<p class="art-p">Mean population (~32 million) sits far above the median because a handful of giants pull the average upward. The distribution is right-skewed: 218 of 259 entries fall into the smallest bin.</p>
