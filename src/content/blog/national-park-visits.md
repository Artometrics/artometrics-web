<p class="art-p art-lede">Golden Gate National Recreation Area recorded 14,554,750 annual visits at its dataset peak — 94 times the system median of 155,219 — because proximity to San Francisco matters more than wilderness purity in the visitation ledger.</p>
<p class="art-p">A TidyTuesday working file of <strong>21,560</strong> park-year records spans <strong>1904–2016</strong>. Median visits sit at <strong>155,219</strong>; the highest single observation reaches <strong>871,922,828</strong>. <strong>Golden Gate</strong> leads the park-name ranking, and region code <strong>IM</strong> (Intermountain) appears most frequently in the data.</p>
<p class="art-p">Urban gateways and memorial parkways often outdraw remote wilderness. The leaderboard reflects access and metropolitan adjacency as much as scenic reputation.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2019-09-17 (R for Data Science community). The working file contains 21,560 rows and 13 columns — park names, regions, years, and visitor totals.</p>
<p class="art-p">Medians handle skew from hyper-visited units. Charts export as Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks. Visitor totals are administrative counts; definition changes over a century mean long-run levels are directional, not exact.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Median visitors rose from <strong>2,200</strong> in the opening period to <strong>198,478</strong> by 2016 — a 90-fold increase driven by automobile access, population growth, system expansion, and the conversion of outdoor recreation into a middle-class norm.</p>
<p class="art-p">The median's climb is the system story; the leaders are the celebrity story.</p>

<p class="art-p"><strong>Golden Gate</strong> leads at <strong>14,554,750</strong> annual visits, with <strong>5,151,270</strong> as the median among the top dozen. Other high-traffic units include urban memorials and parkways — Vietnam Veterans Memorial, World War II Memorial, Lake Mead, Natchez Trace, Cape Cod — where recreation, commuting, and civic pilgrimage overlap.</p>
<p class="art-p">Wilderness icons still matter culturally. They do not win the raw visit count contest against metropolitan National Park Service units that function as public squares with transit access.</p>

<p class="art-p">Regional box plots show whether visitor consensus is shared or contested across NPS regions. Some regions host many modest units; others host a few magnets that dominate the regional total.</p>
<p class="art-p">Spread within a region can exceed differences between region medians. A single gateway park can outdraw an entire cluster of remote units.</p>

<p class="art-p">Region <strong>NT</strong> (National Capital) sits <strong>12,634,481</strong> above the median; <strong>AK</strong> (Alaska) trails by <strong>142,104</strong>. Those gaps encode access and population gravity — Alaska's vast parklands are not built for weekend volume.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The top five park-name entries account for <strong>52%</strong> of aggregate visitors in the working file. Infrastructure stress, concession economics, and reservation politics concentrate in a short list of places — even while the agency's mission names a much longer list.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Community-cleaned TidyTuesday snapshots are not live APIs. Missing values, spelling variants, and century-scale definition changes apply. Visitor counts are not unique individuals and are not measures of ecological impact.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe structural signals about National Park Service visitation patterns in the file — not a conservation audit or a ranking of which landscapes matter most.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Median park traffic rose 90-fold from 1904 to 2016, while the top five units absorbed 52% of all visits. The citable tension is access versus myth: America's most visited park units are often the ones closest to cities and memorials, not the ones on the wilderness postcard.</p>
