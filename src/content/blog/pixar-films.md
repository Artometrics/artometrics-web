<p class="art-p art-lede">Pixar holds a 96% median Rotten Tomatoes score across 24 rated theatrical releases, but two films broke the streak: Cars 2 at 40% and Lightyear. The studio stretched runtimes by 17 minutes between early and recent eras while CinemaScore grades held at A+—audiences stayed loyal even when critics split.</p>
<p class="art-p">This analysis joins TidyTuesday 2025-03-11 Pixar films data with public_response scores: 27 theatrical features, 24 with critic and audience metrics attached. Five charts trace runtime creep, critic floors, audience-critic gaps, rating mix, and the relationship between length and reception.</p>
<p class="art-p">Calibration points: a <strong>96%</strong> median Rotten Tomatoes score; Cars 2 at <strong>40%</strong>; <strong>+17</strong> minutes added to median runtime from early to recent eras; CinemaScore grades clustering at <strong>A+</strong>; a longest runtime of <strong>155</strong> minutes; Toy Story's <strong>81</strong>-minute floor; and <strong>zero</strong> PG-13 ratings in the theatrical set.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The core file pixar_films.csv lists theatrical features with release date, runtime, and MPAA rating. The companion public_response.csv adds Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, CinemaScore, and Critics' Choice scores. Three recent releases lack complete reception fields—treat absent values as missing data, not zero-quality signals.</p>
<p class="art-p">This is not box-office data. The TidyTuesday readme points to a separate box_office extract in the {pixarfilms} R package for revenue analysis. Reception and runtime are the focus here because they are complete in-repo.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-creep" class="anchored">Runtime Creep</h2>
<h3 id="runtime-creep-look" class="anchored">Runtime Over Time</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart1_runtime_timeline.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart1_runtime_timeline.png" role="img" aria-label="Runtime Over Time"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Pixar's theatrical releases did not stay the compact 81-minute package of Toy Story. Median runtime climbed from 98 minutes (through 2006) to 116 minutes for films since 2017—a structural shift in what a Pixar feature is allowed to be.</p>
<p class="art-p">The longest entry runs 155 minutes. Early films clustered around 98 minutes; recent releases expanded by 17 minutes at the median. The change is not noise—it is embedded in the studio's evolving production model.</p>

<h2 id="critic-scores" class="anchored">Critic Scores</h2>
<h3 id="critic-scores-look" class="anchored">Rotten Tomatoes Ranking</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart2_rt_ranking.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart2_rt_ranking.png" role="img" aria-label="Rotten Tomatoes Ranking"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">The median Rotten Tomatoes score across rated films is 96%—elite by any studio standard. Pixar built a reputation on consistency, not occasional brilliance.</p>
<p class="art-p">Cars 2 sits at 40%, the critic floor. Toy Story and several sequels hit 100%. The spread is narrow by Hollywood standards, but the low end clusters around mid-2000s franchise experiments and later IP-forward releases.</p>

<h2 id="audience-vs-critics" class="anchored">Audience vs Critics</h2>
<h3 id="audience-vs-critics-look" class="anchored">Critics vs CinemaScore</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart3_critic_audience_gap.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart3_critic_audience_gap.png" role="img" aria-label="Critics vs CinemaScore"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">CinemaScore grades cluster at A and A+ across the board. Audiences who showed up opening weekend were rarely disappointed—or at least rarely admitted it on exit polls.</p>
<p class="art-p">Critics were the discriminating layer. Films that earned A+ crowd grades still span a 74–100% Rotten Tomatoes range. Pixar optimized for mass affection first, prestige second.</p>

<h2 id="rating-mix" class="anchored">Rating Mix</h2>
<h3 id="rating-mix-look" class="anchored">MPAA Rating Mix</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart4_rating_mix.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/pixar-films/charts/chart4_rating_mix.png" role="img" aria-label="MPAA Rating Mix"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Thirteen films carry a G rating; ten are PG. The brand's family positioning is embedded in the rating structure—zero titles in this file carry PG-13.</p>
<p class="art-p">Pixar expanded runtime and thematic weight without abandoning the all-ages lane in the theatrical set on hand.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-vs-reception" class="anchored">Runtime vs Reception</h2>
<h3 id="runtime-vs-reception-look" class="anchored">Runtime vs Rotten Tomatoes</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Longer films do not automatically score worse—Up, Wall-E, and Inside Out combine runtimes above 95 minutes with scores above 95%.</p>
<p class="art-p">The outliers sit in the lower-right and upper-left: Cars 2 (shorter, weaker Rotten Tomatoes) versus epics that tested patience and still won. Bubble size tracks Metacritic where available—the reception stack is consistent across review systems.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Reception scores are snapshots from Wikipedia-curated tables, not live API pulls. Rotten Tomatoes percentages can shift as reviews are added. CinemaScore is ordinal, not interval—treat cross-film comparisons as directional.</p>
<p class="art-p">The dataset ends with the films included in the March 2025 TidyTuesday release. It does not include Disney+ exclusives or shorts. Runtime and rating analysis covers theatrical features only.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Pixar's measurable story is stability with drift: critics stayed harsh at the margins (Cars 2 at 40%), audiences stayed generous (A+ CinemaScores), and runtimes marched upward (+17 minutes at the median between eras). The brand did not break—it stretched.</p>
<p class="art-p">The myth is magic; the data is a studio learning it could ask for more minutes, more sequels, and still keep the crowd on its side.</p>
