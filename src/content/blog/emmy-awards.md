  Sixty-four years of Emmy records reveal a concentrated awards landscape: Saturday Night Live appears 859 times, 2019 holds 2,613 records—the densest year on file—and 80% of all entries carry the "nominee" label, not "winner." Long-running variety programs accumulate nominations the way careers accumulate credits, producing a recurrence map rather than a single-night sweep story.

  - '859 — Saturday Night Live appearances across the dataset—three times more than the next show'

<p class="art-p art-lede">Saturday Night Live appears 859 times across 29,678 Emmy records from 1957–2021—three times more than the next-closest show and a sign that Emmy concentration tilts toward programs that return year after year rather than one-night sweeps.</p>
<p class="art-p">The working file holds <strong>29,678</strong> records spanning <strong>1957–2021</strong>. Nominee is the most common label, accounting for <strong>23,739</strong> rows—wins and other designations occupy a thinner slice, which means any leaderboard drawn from this extract ranks recurrence more than victory.</p>
<h2 id="fast-facts" class="anchored">Fast facts</h2>
<p class="art-p">The numbers that set the scale for this report:</p>
<div class="facts-grid">
  <div class="fact-box"><span class="fact-number">29,678</span><span class="fact-label">Records in the working dataset</span></div>
  <div class="fact-box"><span class="fact-number">1957–2021</span><span class="fact-label">Year span covered in the file</span></div>

</div>
<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2021-09-21 (R for Data Science community). The working file contains 29,678 rows and 11 columns after merging available tables in the week folder.</p>
<p class="art-p">Charts export as Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks. Counts by type, period, and recurring name are the main instruments—this table captures volume and recurrence rather than a single quality score.</p>

<h2 id="landscape" class="anchored">Landscape</h2>

  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart1_category.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart1_category.png" role="img" aria-label="Nominee dominates with 23,739 records"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Nominee dominates with 23,739 records. The file is built around nomination rows; wins and other type labels sit in a thinner slice.</p>
<p class="art-p">That imbalance is structural—any leaderboard drawn from this extract ranks how often names enter the nominee column, not how often they win.</p>

<h2 id="volume" class="anchored">Volume</h2>
<h3 id="volume-look" class="anchored">Records By Period</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart1_volume.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart1_volume.png" role="img" aria-label="Records By Period"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Activity peaks in 2019 with 2,613 records—the densest year in the span.</p>
<p class="art-p">Period-level counts show when Emmy paperwork thickened: more categories, more programs, more named credits. Volume is the first signal that awards seasons are not equally crowded across decades.</p>

<h2 id="who-sits-at-the-top" class="anchored">Who sits at the top</h2>
<h3 id="who-sits-at-the-top-look" class="anchored">Saturday Night Live appears 859 times — the most recurring name in the file</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart2_leaders.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart2_leaders.png" role="img" aria-label="Saturday Night Live appears 859 times — the most recurring name in the file"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Saturday Night Live appears 859 times—the most recurring name in the file. The top dozen account for a visible share of all 29,678 rows.</p>
<p class="art-p">Long-running variety and franchise programs accumulate nominations the way long careers accumulate credits. Dominance here is recurrence, not a single sweep night.</p>

<h2 id="category" class="anchored">Category</h2>
<h3 id="category-look" class="anchored">Nominee is the largest bucket with 23,739 records</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart3_category.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart3_category.png" role="img" aria-label="Nominee is the largest bucket with 23,739 records"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Nominee is the largest bucket with 23,739 records. Category concentration shows where editorial attention should focus when reading the table.</p>
<p class="art-p">If the question is "who swept," separate win rows carefully. If the question is "who kept getting invited," this nominee-heavy landscape is the right map.</p>

<h2 id="timeline" class="anchored">Timeline</h2>
<h3 id="timeline-look" class="anchored">Leaders Over Time</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart4_timeline.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/emmy-awards/charts/chart4_timeline.png" role="img" aria-label="Leaders Over Time"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">Leading names do not move in lockstep—some fade as others surge.</p>
<p class="art-p">Tracking counts over time separates sustained presence from one-off spikes. A show that dominates a single ceremony is a different data shape from a name that returns for decades.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Community-cleaned TidyTuesday snapshots are not live APIs. Missing values, spelling variants, and week-of-export coverage limits apply. Merged tables may fan out or duplicate rows when join keys are imperfect.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe the file on hand—structural signals about Emmy nomination volume and recurrence through 2021, not a complete history of television quality.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Emmy concentration shows up as recurrence: Saturday Night Live at 859 appearances, a nominee column that holds 23,739 of 29,678 rows, and a 2019 peak of 2,613 records. Leaders, volume, and timelines each answer a different question about how lopsided the season became.</p>
<p class="art-p">Use the charts to separate invitation from victory—then check the type field before treating any name as a sweep.</p>
