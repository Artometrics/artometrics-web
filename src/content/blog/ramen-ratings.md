  A 3,180-record TidyTuesday dataset from June 2019 places the median instant-ramen rating at 3.75 stars on a 5.00 scale. Dozens of brands share the perfect score, compressing the top into a plateau. Malaysia sits 0.50 stars above the median; Thailand trails by 0.25. The meaningful story lives in mid-range country gaps and review volume behind elite scores.
keyPoints:
  - 3.75 — Median stars across 3,180 reviews — half of all ratings fall at or above this threshold
  - 5.00 — Ceiling shared by TTL, Tseng Noodles, A-Sha, Prima Taste, and a dozen other perfect-score brands
  - 0.50 — Malaysia's lead above the median — the largest positive country gap in the dataset
  - 0.25 — Thailand's deficit below the median — a material disadvantage on a compressed five-point scale
  - Japan — Most common country label by product count, though volume does not guarantee rating leadership

<p class="art-p art-lede">The median instant-ramen rating in a 3,180-record TidyTuesday sample is 3.75 stars on a five-point scale, but dozens of brands share the 5.00 ceiling — compressing the top into a plateau where Malaysia's 0.50-star lead above the median becomes the most meaningful country gap.</p>
<p class="art-p">Star ratings collapse broth clarity, noodle chew, spice balance, and packaging nostalgia into a single number. A TidyTuesday working file from June 2019 shows <strong>3,180</strong> reviews with a median of <strong>3.75</strong> and a maximum of <strong>5.00</strong>. <strong>Nongshim</strong> leads the brand ranking in the fact box, and <strong>Japan</strong> is the most common country label by product count — though output volume and rating leadership do not align.</p>
<p class="art-p">When perfect scores are common, the useful story lives below the ceiling: which countries sit above the median, and whether high ratings rest on thin or thick review support.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2019-06-04, maintained by the R for Data Science community. The working file contains 3,180 rows and six columns after cleaning: brand, variety, style, country, stars, and review number.</p>
<p class="art-p">Medians handle a distribution piled against the 5.00 ceiling. Charts export as Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks. Stars are community review scores, not laboratory nutrition assays.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Brand rollups at the top of the chart crowd the <strong>5.00</strong> ceiling. TTL, Tseng Noodles, A-Sha, Prima Taste, and other specialists occupy the perfect-score band. When the top saturates, discrimination shifts to consistency across varieties and the number of reviews behind the mean.</p>
<p class="art-p">Nongshim's fact-box lead can coexist with a chart full of smaller perfect-score brands because aggregation choices — mean across varieties, review weighting, or maximum score — change the ranking order.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p"><strong>TTL</strong> leads at <strong>5.00</strong>, and the median among the top dozen is also <strong>5.00</strong>. The elite band is a plateau, not a ladder. Perfect scores are common enough that first place is a crowded room.</p>
<p class="art-p">Tiny rank differences among five-star brands carry little information. The useful comparisons appear in the middle of the distribution and across countries.</p>

<p class="art-p">Country box plots show whether star consensus is shared or contested across producing nations. Japan leads by product count; Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, and Singapore compete on rating location rather than volume.</p>
<p class="art-p">A country can dominate shelf presence without dominating the upper quartile of stars. The spread chart separates industrial scale from taste prestige.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p"><strong>Malaysia</strong> sits <strong>0.50</strong> stars above the median; <strong>Thailand</strong> trails by <strong>0.25</strong>. Those gaps look small until you remember the scale runs to 5.00 and the median is already 3.75.</p>
<p class="art-p">Half a star above center is a material national reputation effect in a compressed rating system. It is also narrow enough that a few legendary varieties can move a country's summary.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Plotting stars against review number reveals clusters that averages hide. Some high-rated varieties have thin review support; some heavily reviewed products sit nearer the middle. Attention and admiration are related, not identical.</p>
<p class="art-p">Review-number fields in the source can behave as identifiers as much as popularity counts. The scatter prevents readers from equating a perfect score with a broadly tested consensus.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Community-cleaned TidyTuesday snapshots are not live APIs. Missing values, spelling variants, and brand-name duplicates apply. Stars are not sales, and country labels do not always indicate where a variety is consumed most.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe structural signals in ramen rating metadata, not a definitive world championship of instant noodles.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Instant ramen ratings in this file center near 3.75 stars, with a crowded perfect-score ceiling at 5.00 and country gaps of 0.25 to 0.50 stars around the median.</p>
<p class="art-p">When the top is a plateau of five-star brands, the meaningful geography is which countries sit above the middle and how much review support stands behind the praise. Malaysia's 0.50-star lead and Thailand's 0.25-star deficit matter more than first-place ties at the ceiling.</p>
