  A tokenized Sherlock Holmes corpus of 65,958 records shows a median word count of 12.0 and mean of 10.9—a near-symmetric distribution. The top five book entries account for 34% of total word count, while the leading title, The Yellow Face, reaches only 13.0, barely above the file-wide median.
keyPoints:
  - '65,958 — Records in tokenized corpus — each row represents one text unit, not a complete story'
  - '12.0 — Median word count — identical to the median among the top twelve titles'
  - '34% — Share held by top five books — modest concentration with no runaway leader'
faq:
  - question: What does word count measure in this dataset?
    answer: >-
      Word count is a field in the tokenized corpus, not total story length; each of 65,958 records represents a text segment.
  - question: Which story has the highest word count?
    answer: >-
      The Yellow Face leads at 13.0 words per record, one word above the corpus median of 12.0.
  - question: How concentrated is the corpus across books?
    answer: >-
      The top five books hold 34% of aggregate word count; the remainder distributes across a long tail of titles.
  - question: Is the distribution skewed?
    answer: >-
      Median 12.0 and mean 10.9 indicate near symmetry with minimal right skew.

<p class="art-p art-lede">The tokenized Sherlock Holmes corpus from TidyTuesday contains 65,958 records with a median word count of 12.0 and a mean of 10.9—evidence of a nearly symmetric distribution. The top-ranked title, The Yellow Face, reaches 13.0 words per record, just one word above the file-wide median, while the top five books together account for 34% of aggregate word count.</p>
<p class="art-p">The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet appears as the top-ranked book by word count in the fact box; The Yellow Face leads the charted breakdown at 13.0. This analysis tracks textual mass in a tokenized extract, not literary merit or narrative arc.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2025-11-18, published by the R for Data Science community. The working file contains 65,958 rows and 4 columns after merging available tables. Book titles serve as the primary categorical axis; word count is the primary numeric metric.</p>
<p class="art-p">Medians are used because text-length fields can skew. The distribution here shows median 12.0 and mean 10.9, indicating relative symmetry. Index-style fields are excluded from metric selection.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The Yellow Face leads at 13.0 words per record; A Case of Identity anchors the low end at 12.0. The visible spread is narrow, reflecting tight clustering across many titles in the tokenized corpus.</p>
<p class="art-p">Grouping by book exposes length variation across the catalog without requiring plot summaries. The question here is structural concentration, not detective methodology.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The Yellow Face leads at 13.0, while the median among the top twelve is 12.0—identical to the file-wide median. Leading in this extract does not imply a dramatic leap; it means a single-word edge inside a compressed distribution.</p>
<p class="art-p">That compression is the finding. Holmes stories in this tokenization do not diverge into wildly different word-count regimes at the center of the leaderboard.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The full-sample distribution shows median 12.0 and mean 10.9—near symmetry rather than heavy right skew. The top decile begins at 14.0; that upper slice contains the longer textual segments in this metric.</p>
<p class="art-p">Symmetry matters for citation. A median-centered account of Holmes text length is more faithful than an average distorted by outliers.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The top five book entries account for 34% of aggregate word count. Concentration is real but not absolute: a meaningful head exists, yet a long tail of other titles still holds the majority of textual mass.</p>
<p class="art-p">This concentration curve means editorial attention can begin with a small set of books without ignoring the rest of the canon.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">A second cumulative chart repeats the concentration view: the top five book entries again account for 34% of aggregate word count. Parallel concentration cuts serve as a robustness check when the pipeline exports multiple figures.</p>
<p class="art-p">The takeaway holds. A compact set of titles carries a disproportionate share of the summed word-count field in this 65,958-row extract.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">TidyTuesday snapshots are community-cleaned teaching datasets, not live literary APIs. Tokenization choices, spelling variants in titles, and week-of-export coverage limits apply. Word count here is the field in the file—not an independent scholarly page count or a proxy for narrative complexity.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe this extract. They are structural signals about textual mass across books, not claims about literary quality or cultural importance.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">The tokenized Holmes corpus centers tightly: median word count 12.0, mean 10.9, top decile from 14.0, and leaders such as The Yellow Face only one word above the median.</p>
<p class="art-p">Concentration is modest—the top five books hold 34% of aggregate word count—but no single title dominates. The textual mass accumulates without extreme median drift, and the distribution remains nearly symmetric across 65,958 records.</p>
