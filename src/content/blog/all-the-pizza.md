  A TidyTuesday pizza extract of 10,000 menu records reveals a median price-range minimum of 0.00 and a premium tier at 50.0. The mass of listings sits at zero or missing values, while a thin tail of destination pizzerias cluster at 40–50, requiring separate citation strategies for market claims.
keyPoints:
  - '10,000 — Records in the dataset'
  - '0.00 — Median price-range minimum across all entries'
  - '50.0 — Highest observed price-range minimum'
  - '40.0 — Median price-range minimum among the top twelve names'
faq:
  - question: How many records are in this dataset?
    answer: 10,000 records from the TidyTuesday pizza_datafiniti.csv extract.
  - question: What is the median price-range minimum?
    answer: The median price-range minimum is 0.00, indicating most listings have zero or missing price floors.
  - question: What price floor marks the premium tier?
    answer: The top-dozen names have a median price-range minimum of 40.0, with leaders reaching 50.0.
  - question: How should I cite pizza price in this file?
    answer: Use the global median of 0.00 for typical listings and the top-dozen median of 40.0 for premium or destination pizzerias.

<p class="art-p art-lede">Pizza prices appear simple until you compare 10,000 menu rows. The Datafiniti pizza extract in TidyTuesday (released 2019-10-01) does exactly that: restaurant-level records with price-range fields revealing how "a slice" and "a specialty pie" occupy different economic tiers. The dataset contains <strong>10,000</strong> rows, with a median price-range minimum of <strong>0.00</strong> and a premium peak at <strong>50.0</strong>.</p>
<p class="art-p">The median price-range minimum of <strong>0.00</strong> signals that most listings encode missing or zero price floors rather than free pizza. The highest observed price-range minimum is <strong>50.0</strong>, shared by Oregano and Crust Stone Oven Pizza. That ceiling marks where tasting-menu and destination pizzerias sit — a tier separated by economics and intent from the mass market below.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2019-10-01 (pizza_datafiniti.csv). The analysis frame contains 10,000 records after cleaning.</p>
<p class="art-p">Price-range minimum is the ranked metric across all charts. Medians are used because the distribution clusters heavily at low values. Charts are Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">At the top of the price-range-minimum ranking, Oregano and Crust Stone Oven Pizza both reach <strong>50.0</strong>. Just below, a cluster of shops—Papa's Pizza, Apizza Scholls, Barbaro, La Montanara, Spin, Dough Pizzeria Napoletana—sits at <strong>40.0</strong>.</p>
<p class="art-p">These are not typical delivery-store price floors. They mark the upper edge of how this dataset encodes premium positioning. Most of the 10,000-row catalog never approaches that band.</p>

<h2 id="the-top-dozen-is-a-premium-plateau" class="anchored">The Top Dozen Is a Premium Plateau</h2>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Crust Stone Oven Pizza leads at <strong>50.0</strong>, and the median among the top dozen is <strong>40.0</strong>. Inside the premium tier, the story is less about a single outlier than about a shared price floor.</p>
<p class="art-p">That plateau is useful for citation: when asked what "expensive pizza" looks like in this file, the answer is a top-dozen median of 40—not the global median of 0.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The distribution is extreme. Roughly <strong>8,167</strong> rows fall in the lowest price-range-minimum bin, with about <strong>1,801</strong> in the next populated band. Only a few dozen observations occupy the high bins near 40–50.</p>
<p class="art-p">This is why the median of 0.00 is technically correct yet narratively incomplete. The market's mass is coded at zero or missing; the cultural story lives in the thin right tail.</p>

<p class="art-p">The Pareto view of price-range minimum among leading names climbs steeply: the first five entries hold roughly <strong>43%</strong> of the plotted aggregate, and the curve reaches the full total by the fifteenth name.</p>
<p class="art-p">Concentration here measures how high price-floor labels cluster among a short list of restaurant names, not sales volume or market share.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Scatter points of price-range minimum against price-range maximum show the expected diagonal: shops with higher floors also list higher ceilings, with some pairs reaching from 40 up toward 55.</p>
<p class="art-p">The mismatches are instructive—low floors with wide ceilings, or compressed ranges signaling a single-price menu. Those are the places where "pizza" stops being one product and becomes a price architecture.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Datafiniti restaurant scrapes are not audited menus. Zero price-range values may indicate missing data rather than free food. Name collisions and chain-versus-independent ambiguity persist.</p>
<p class="art-p">The extract cannot address ingredient costs, tip culture, or city-level rent. It measures listed price-range fields in a 2019 community snapshot.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">In 10,000 pizza rows, the market's mass sits at a median price-range minimum of 0.00, while a thin premium tier reaches 50.0.</p>
<p class="art-p">Cite the top-dozen median of 40 when discussing destination pizza; cite the global median when discussing typical listings. They describe different economies.</p>
