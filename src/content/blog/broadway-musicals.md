<p class="art-p art-lede">Springsteen On Broadway averages $509 per ticket—nearly double Hamilton's $273 and more than eight times the $60.2 industry median. This gap separates concert-style residencies from long-running musicals and reveals two parallel pricing markets operating inside the same theater district.</p>
<p class="art-p">The TidyTuesday grosses dataset holds 47,524 performance records. Broadhurst Theatre appears most frequently; Springsteen On Broadway claims the highest average ticket price. The data map a clear division: established houses run near stable mid-range prices, while event residencies reset the ceiling.</p>

<p class="art-p">Average ticket price versus performances shows low-price, low-performance weeks and occasional high-price short runs. Long runs at moderate prices remain the traditional musical model.</p>
<p class="art-p">The scatter resists a simple correlation: expensive tickets do not always signal short runs, and longevity does not require discounting. Broadway monetizes both scarcity and stamina.</p>

<p class="art-p">Grosses data include atypical weeks, previews, and dark periods sometimes coded as zeros. Average ticket price does not reflect face value for every seat. Concert residencies mix genres inside a Broadway dataset.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Broadway's median average ticket in this dataset is $60.2, while event residencies reach $509. The top-dozen median of $182 defines the premium club without equating to the Springsteen outlier.</p>
