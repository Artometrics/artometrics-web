<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Community-cleaned TidyTuesday snapshots are not live APIs. Missing values, spelling variants, and week-of-export coverage limits apply. Merged tables may fan out or duplicate rows when join keys are imperfect.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe the file on hand—treat them as structural signals about Simpsons guest appearances, not exhaustive truth about the full domain.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Read as a teaching map, this dataset shows why one metric is rarely enough: leaders, tails, trends, and relationships each answer a different question about guest-appearance patterns.</p>
<p class="art-p">The best reading is modest: use the chart to sharpen the question, then check the source and limits before turning it into a claim.</p>
