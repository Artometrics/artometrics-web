<p class="art-p">The Billboard Hot 100 is a weekly ranking machine: 100 positions, endlessly refreshed. The TidyTuesday billboard extract used here holds <strong>100,000</strong> song-week rows, with a median week position of <strong>50.0</strong> — exactly mid-chart — and a highest observed week position of <strong>100</strong> (the bottom rung).</p>
<p class="art-p">That median of 50 is almost tautological in a full 1–100 ranking, which is why the interesting questions shift to concentration, re-entries (instance), and which titles spend time at the chart’s edges. “Down By The River” appears among the fact-box leaders for week position in this working file.</p>

<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2021-09-14 (billboard.csv). After cleaning, the analysis sample contains 100,000 records.</p>
<p class="art-p">Week position is the primary metric; lower numbers are better ranks in Billboard’s native scale, but several charts here rank the numeric position field directly as stored. Charts are Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">When songs are ranked by week-position summaries, a block of titles ties at <strong>100</strong> — including Girl (You Captivate Me), Time Seller, Gee Baby (I’m Sorry), and others. Those are songs whose observed positions in this aggregation sit at the chart floor.</p>
<p class="art-p">The chart is less a hall of fame than a map of how many titles live at the margins of the Hot 100’s attention economy.</p>

<h2 id="leaders-by-week-position-are-a-flat-elite" class="anchored">Leaders by Week Position Are a Flat Elite</h2>
<h3 id="leaders-by-week-position-are-a-flat-elite-look" class="anchored">(Quarter To Four) Stomp leads at 100 — 100 marks the median among the top dozen</h3>
<figure class="art-chart">
  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/billboard-top-100/charts/chart2_leaders.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/billboard-top-100/charts/chart2_leaders.png" role="img" aria-label="(Quarter To Four) Stomp leads at 100 — 100 marks the median among the top dozen"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">(Quarter To Four) Stomp and peer titles in the leaders view hit <strong>100</strong>, and the median among the top dozen is also <strong>100</strong>. There is no graded ladder here — the “leaders” by this numeric field are a plateau at the bottom rank.</p>
<p class="art-p">That flatness is informative: many songs brush the Hot 100 without climbing. Presence is not the same as dominance.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-positions-fill-the-chart-almost-uniformly" class="anchored">Weekly Positions Fill the Chart Almost Uniformly</h2>
<h3 id="weekly-positions-fill-the-chart-almost-uniformly-look" class="anchored">Week position Distribution</h3>

  <div class="art-chart-live" data-chart="/data/articles/billboard-top-100/charts/chart3_distribution.plotly.json" data-source="Data: TidyTuesday / R for Data Science community - ARTOMETRICS" data-fallback="/images/content/articles/billboard-top-100/charts/chart3_distribution.png" role="img" aria-label="Week position Distribution"></div>
</figure>
<p class="art-p">The distribution of week positions across the 100,000-row sample is remarkably even: bin counts hover near <strong>5,000</strong> observations across the 1–100 range. A full Hot 100 every week produces that rectangular shape by design.</p>
<p class="art-p">Uniform position counts are the baseline. Deviations in other charts — concentration among songs, re-entry instances — are where the cultural story lives.</p>

<h2 id="concentration-among-songs-is-mechanical-at-first" class="anchored">Concentration Among Songs Is Mechanical at First</h2>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The Pareto curve over leading song entries rises in near-equal steps in this view, reaching 100% by the fifteenth plotted entry. Within the restricted leader set, share accumulates steadily rather than in a single spike.</p>
<p class="art-p">Full-catalog fame concentration is a different question; this curve describes the ranked subset on display, not every Hot 100 occupant since the 1950s.</p>

<h2 id="re-entries-stretch-a-song-s-life-without-guaranteeing-rank" class="anchored">Re-Entries Stretch a Song’s Life Without Guaranteeing Rank</h2>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Week position versus instance (re-entry or appearance count) shows titles returning to the chart at many ranks. High instance values appear across both strong and weak positions.</p>
<p class="art-p">Longevity on Billboard is not only about peaking at No. 1. It is also about how many times a song is allowed to reappear — a second career path the scatter makes visible.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Billboard’s chart methodology has changed over decades (sales, airplay, streaming). A pooled file mixes eras with different rules. Song-title collisions and punctuation variants can split or merge identities.</p>
<p class="art-p">Numeric “leaders” by week position in this stack highlight the bottom of the chart, not the cultural canon. Read rank direction carefully before citing.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">A 100,000-row Hot 100 extract is mostly a uniform grid of weekly ranks — median 50, full coverage from 1 to 100. The drama is in which songs repeatedly occupy that grid and which only touch position 100.</p>
<p class="art-p">Cite the uniform distribution when explaining the chart’s structure; cite instance versus position when explaining how hits persist.</p>
