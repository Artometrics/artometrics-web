  Across 173 college majors, psychology graduates account for 48,207 low-wage jobs—nearly twice the second-place count. The overall median is 1,231, but the top dozen average 26,912, concentrating underemployment in a handful of high-enrollment fields. Engineering's median of 372 demonstrates that major choice correlates with wage-floor risk independent of unemployment.
keyPoints:
  - 48,207 — Psychology low-wage jobs — twenty times the category median
  - 26,912 — Median among top-twelve majors — twenty-two times the overall median
  - 372 — Engineering category median — thirteen percent of humanities' 3,466
  - 1,231 — Overall median — reveals extreme concentration in popular majors
  - 173 — Majors analyzed — Engineering most common category label
faq:
  - question: Which major has the most low-wage jobs?
    answer: >-
      Psychology leads with 48,207 low-wage jobs, nearly double Business Management's 32,395.
  - question: What is the median low-wage job count across all majors?
    answer: >-
      The median is 1,231 low-wage jobs; the top dozen majors average 26,912.
  - question: How does engineering compare to humanities?
    answer: >-
      Engineering's median is 372 low-wage jobs versus 3,466 for humanities—a ninefold difference.
  - question: Do low-wage counts correlate with unemployment rates?
    answer: >-
      No—the scatter shows majors with high low-wage counts but low unemployment, and vice versa.

<p class="art-p art-lede">Psychology graduates account for <strong>48,207</strong> low-wage jobs across the 173 majors in this TidyTuesday extract—nearly double the second-place total and forty times the overall median of <strong>1,231</strong>. Engineering, the most common category label, carries a median of just <strong>372</strong>, revealing that major choice predicts wage-floor exposure independent of unemployment.</p>
<p class="art-p">This framing inverts the prestige narrative: the analysis leads with the count of graduates in low-wage work, then pairs it with unemployment rates. Pay ceilings matter, but so does the size of the floor.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Low wage jobs versus unemployment rate spreads majors across both axes. Some fields show elevated unemployment with modest low-wage counts; others show large low-wage tallies without sitting at the top of the unemployment ranking.</p>
<p class="art-p">The scatter's warning is practical: underemployment and joblessness are related labor-market failures, but they measure different risks—and majors can fail on either axis.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Low-wage job counts favor large majors; rates would reorder the list. "Recent graduates" definitions and survey vintages constrain comparison. Category bins are broad—"Engineering" hides subfield wage gaps.</p>
<p class="art-p">The file cannot speak to graduate-school pathways that delay earnings, or to geographic cost-of-living differences that redefine what "low wage" means.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Across 173 majors, the median low-wage count is 1,231, while psychology alone exceeds 48,000. The top-dozen median of 26,912 shows how concentrated the exposure is.</p>
<p class="art-p">Cite category gaps when comparing fields of study, and keep unemployment on a separate axis—low-wage absorption and joblessness are twin risks, not synonyms.</p>
