  Rolling Stone's 2003 greatest-albums list contains 691 records with a median rank of 250. "Touch" leads the numeric rank field at 500, studio albums dominate the type distribution, and release years span 1955–2019. The list is an editorial artifact — a frozen moment of taste presented as permanent infrastructure.
keyPoints:
  - 691 — Records in the working dataset — the full scope of this TidyTuesday extract
  - 250 — Median 2003 rank — the midpoint of the canonical numbering system
  - 500 — Highest observed 2003 rank — "Touch" sits at the numeric edge of the list
  - 1955–2019 — Release-year span — six decades of albums frozen in a 2003 ranking
  - Studio — Most common album type — the format Rolling Stone's canon privileges

<p class="art-p art-lede">Rolling Stone's 2003 greatest-albums list contains 691 records with a median rank of 250, and "Touch" sits at 500 — the numeric edge of a canon that spans 1955–2019 and privileges studio albums over all other formats.</p>
<p class="art-p">The list is an editorial artifact. It freezes taste at a moment, then presents that freeze as permanent infrastructure. The working file shows how the freeze distributes: median rank at <strong>250</strong>, highest observed rank at <strong>500</strong>, studio albums as the default type, and a six-decade release span that carries albums from mid-century to the cusp of streaming.</p>
<p class="art-p">Rank numbers run inverse to prestige — lower is better — but the charts below follow the file's stated leaders and medians without imposing a second scoring system.</p>

<h2 id="data-and-method" class="anchored">Data and method</h2>
<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday Rolling Stone albums release from the R for Data Science community. The working file contains 691 rows — album titles, artists, release years, types, genre labels, and 2003 rank fields.</p>
<p class="art-p">Medians summarize a curated elite, not a random sample of recorded music. Charts export as Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks. A magazine canon is an editorial object; treating it as market data misreads the politics of taste.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-pattern-changed-over-time-look" class="anchored">Median Rank 2003 Over Time</h3>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Median 2003 rank across release years shows which eras the list favored when the ranking was locked. Mid-century and classic-rock decades sit differently from later indie and hip-hop entries — a fingerprint of the canon's compositional politics.</p>
<p class="art-p">The rank field is anchored in 2003, so later release years in the file mark albums added after the original freeze or coverage quirks in the TidyTuesday extract.</p>
<h2 id="who-sits-at-the-top" class="anchored">Who sits at the top of the numeric rank field</h2>
<h3 id="who-sits-at-the-top-look" class="anchored">Touch leads at 500 — 494 marks the median among the top dozen</h3>

</figure>
<p class="art-p"><strong>Touch</strong> leads at <strong>500</strong>, with <strong>494</strong> as the median among the top dozen in this ordering. The upper numeric band clusters albums near the far end of the 2003 list's numbering.</p>
<p class="art-p">Nearby titles — Guitar Town, Entertainment!, All the Young Dudes, Vitalogy, She's So Unusual — show how the list's lower prestige tier remains a hall of fame by ordinary standards. Being near 500 on a Rolling Stone 500 is not obscurity.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Box plots by type show whether rank consensus is shared or contested across release formats. Studio albums dominate because rock-critical canons historically privileged them over compilations, live records, and other forms.</p>
<p class="art-p">Type concentration is an editorial fingerprint. A canon that underweights non-studio formats makes an aesthetic argument, not a neutral count of what exists.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The gap chart ranks types above or below the median 2003 rank. Differences encode which formats the list treated as central versus peripheral when the ranking was composed.</p>
<p class="art-p">The entire file is already an elite list, so trailing the median still means membership in a magazine's chosen 500 — a narrow world compared with all recorded music.</p>
<h2 id="what-moves-together" class="anchored">Rank and artist age</h2>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Plotting 2003 rank against average age at the top-500 marker shows clusters that averages erase. Some high-prestige albums come from young breakthrough artists; others from later-career peaks. The scatter refuses a single myth about youth and canonization.</p>
<p class="art-p">Age is not destiny on a critical list, but it is a recurring covariate in rock historiography. The cloud shows variation that simplistic narratives hide.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">Community-cleaned TidyTuesday snapshots are not live APIs. Missing values, spelling variants, and list-version mismatches apply. A 2003 rank is not a 2020s streaming share, and Rolling Stone's taste is not the world's taste.</p>
<p class="art-p">Findings describe structural signals about one magazine canon's metadata — not a universal ranking of recorded music, and not a substitute for listening.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Rolling Stone's 2003 album canon contains 691 rows with a median rank of 250, studio albums as the dominant type, and a numeric range that runs to 500. The file encodes genre and generation politics: canons freeze taste at a moment, then teach that freeze as permanent.</p>
<p class="art-p">The charts make the freeze measurable — the rest is interpretation.</p>
