<p class="art-p art-lede">Colorado leads U.S. exercise participation at <strong>32.0</strong>, while the median across <strong>52</strong> jurisdictions stands at <strong>23.0</strong>.

<p class="art-p">The data, from TidyTuesday's 2018 exercise extract, shows geographic concentration rather than even distribution. The charts document the spread, the gap between leaders and the median, and the relationship between adult and male participation rates.</p>

<p class="art-p">The tallest bin centers near <strong>23.5</strong> with approximately <strong>15</strong> states. Smaller counts appear in both the mid-teens and the high-20s/30s. The mean of 22.6 sits close to the median, indicating symmetry at the state level.</p>

<p class="art-p">Adults and Men track together across 52 jurisdictions: states with higher adult participation rates also post higher male rates. Leaders reach the low-to-mid 30s on the adults axis and the 30s–40s range on the men's axis.</p>

<p class="art-p">Self-reported exercise measures vary by survey methodology and year. State averages mask within-state variation by urban/rural location and race. D.C. is included but is not a state.</p>
