  Captive cetacean transfer records from 1946–2017 concentrate overwhelmingly in US institutions (2,172 of 2,194 entries) and bottlenose dolphins (1,668 records). Annual volume peaked in 1972 at roughly 170 entries, then declined through the 2010s.
keyPoints:
  - '1,668 — Bottlenose dolphins — 76% of all records, dwarfing orcas (79) and belugas (68)'
  - '2,172 — US-labeled transfers — 99% of the dataset, versus 22 foreign entries'
  - '170 — Peak year count in 1972 — transfers declined steadily after the late 1970s'
faq:
  - question: >-
      How many cetacean transfer records are in this dataset?
    answer: >-
      2,194 records spanning 1946–2017, drawn from the TidyTuesday 2018-12-18 release.
  - question: >-
      Why does bottlenose dominate the dataset?
    answer: >-
      Bottlenose dolphins appear in 1,668 records (76%), reflecting US captivity history; other species are sparse by comparison.
  - question: >-
      When did cetacean transfers peak?
    answer: >-
      Annual record counts peaked around 1972 at roughly 170 entries, with smaller spikes in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

<p class="art-p art-lede">Captive cetacean transfer records from 1946–2017 concentrate overwhelmingly in US institutions: <strong>2,172</strong> of <strong>2,194</strong> entries carry a US label, and bottlenose dolphins account for <strong>1,668</strong> records—76% of the file.

<p class="art-p">Bottlenose transfers spike with the early-1970s volume peak (about <strong>144</strong> in 1972). Orca records show smaller pulses across the late 1960s–1980s. Beluga counts rise in scattered later years. White-sided labels show activity in the 1970s–1980s.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">US overrepresentation may reflect data compilation, not true global distribution. Species name variants (Beluga vs Beluga Whale; multiple white-sided spellings) fragment counts.</p>
<p class="art-p">The file does not measure welfare outcomes, wild population status, or legal regime changes except insofar as they altered what got recorded.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Across 2,194 rows, the story is concentration twice over: US geography (2,172) and bottlenose identity (1,668).</p>
<p class="art-p">Cite the 1972 volume peak when discussing historical intensity, and treat non-bottlenose species as sparse but distinct timelines inside a bottlenose-dominated ledger.</p>
