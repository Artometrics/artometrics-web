<p class="art-p">BoardGameGeek ratings are a public taste machine: tens of thousands of titles, each scored by the people willing to log plays. The TidyTuesday board-games extract used here holds <strong>10,532</strong> records with a median average rating of <strong>6.39</strong> and a high of <strong>9.00</strong> for Small World Designer Edition.</p>
<p class="art-p">Wargame, World War II is the most common category label in the file. That already tilts the catalog toward conflict simulations — a hobby subculture with its own rating norms. The charts ask how ratings split by category, how leaders separate from the median, and whether crowdfunding-scale user counts track with elite scores.</p>

<p class="art-p">The source is the TidyTuesday release from 2019-03-12 (board_games.csv). After cleaning, 10,532 rows remain in the working frame.</p>
<p class="art-p">Average rating is the primary metric. Category fields can be multi-label strings. Charts are Plotly JSON with PNG fallbacks. The year span encoded in the fact box reflects the filtered time field present in this build of the file.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">The time view in this extract collapses to a median average rating of about <strong>6.39</strong> — the same calibration point as the fact box. In BoardGameGeek terms, that mid-6s band is ordinary: playable, not legendary.</p>
<p class="art-p">Everything that follows should be read against that baseline. A 9.00 specialty edition is not “a bit better than average”; it is a different prestige tier.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Small World Designer Edition leads at <strong>9.00</strong>. Kingdom Death: Monster (~<strong>8.93</strong>), Terra Mystica: Big Box (~<strong>8.85</strong>), and a run of deep wargames — Last Chance for Victory, The Greatest Day, Last Blitzkrieg, Enemy Action: Ardennes — fill out the top dozen. The median among those leaders is about <strong>8.78</strong>.</p>
<p class="art-p">These are not mass-market party games. They are hobby-complete objects — big boxes, campaign systems, hex-and-counter epics — rated by audiences selected for intensity.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Category boxes show Napoleonic wargames with a median near <strong>7.04</strong> (n=124) and World War II wargames near <strong>6.89</strong> (n=449). Card games sit lower, with a median near <strong>6.03</strong> (n=438). Abstract strategy lands near <strong>6.28</strong> (n=284).</p>
<p class="art-p">Volume and prestige diverge: card games are numerous but center closer to the catalog median; dedicated wargame labels clear a higher bar among the people who rate them.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Gaps to the overall median are largest for American Civil War wargames (~<strong>+0.66</strong>) and Napoleonic wargames (~<strong>+0.65</strong>), with World War II wargames also positive. Dice and generic card-game labels sit below the median.</p>
<p class="art-p">The pattern is consistent: historical conflict simulations, as tagged in this file, are the categories that most reliably clear the 6.39 baseline.</p>

</figure>
<p class="art-p">Average rating versus users rated shows popular hits with tens of thousands of ratings landing across the mid-to-high 7s, while many high-rated titles still have modest user counts. Elite scores without crowd scale remain possible.</p>
<p class="art-p">The scatter’s lesson is citable: popularity predicts attention, not a precise quality score. A 9.00 designer edition and a 7.4 smash hit solve different problems in the hobby economy.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">BoardGameGeek ratings are self-selected by hobbyists; children’s games and mass-market titles can be systematically under- or over-represented. Multi-label categories double-count games across boxes.</p>
<p class="art-p">Expansions and designer editions inflate prestige relative to base games. The file is a 2019 community snapshot, not a live BGG API pull.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Across 10,532 games, the median rating is 6.39; the top dozen lives near 8.8–9.0. Wargame categories clear the baseline more often than broad card-game labels.</p>
<p class="art-p">Cite 6.39 as the catalog’s center of gravity, and treat 9.00 specialty editions as a separate prestige economy — not as proof that “games got better.”</p>
