  U.S. craft beer's strength distribution centers on 6% ABV across 2,410 records. Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 — Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale tops the range at 12.8%. High-ABV outliers above 10% represent a boutique tail; most beers cluster near session strength, and bitterness (IBU) rises with alcohol but not uniformly.
keyPoints:
  - '2,410 — Records in the dataset after cleaning'
  - '6% — Median ABV, the typical craft-beer strength'
  - '12.8% — Maximum ABV, held by Lee Hill Series Vol. 5'
  - '37% — Share of aggregate ABV held by the top five high-strength beers'
faq:
  - question: What is the median ABV of U.S. craft beer in this dataset?
    answer: >-
      The median ABV is 6% (0.06).
  - question: Which beer has the highest ABV?
    answer: >-
      Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 — Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale, at 12.8%.
  - question: Do high-ABV beers always have high IBU?
    answer: >-
      No; stouts and quads reach high ABV with low bitterness, while IPAs pair both.
  - question: How many beers exceed 10% ABV?
    answer: >-
      Fewer than a dozen in the top tier; the distribution is right-skewed with a thin high-gravity tail.

<p class="art-p art-lede">The strongest U.S. craft beer in this 2,410-record extract reaches <strong>12.8% ABV</strong> (Lee Hill Series Vol. 5 — Belgian Style Quadrupel Ale), but the median sits at <strong>6%</strong>. High-gravity outliers above 10% form a boutique tail; the bulk of the catalog clusters near session-to-standard strength, with bitterness (IBU) rising alongside alcohol in hop-forward styles but diverging in malt-heavy quads and stouts.</p>
<p class="art-p">The distribution is right-skewed: hundreds of beers occupy the 5–6% bins, counts fall past 9%, and the famous 12–13% outliers are rare.</p>

<p class="art-p">ABV versus IBU across roughly 1,400 plotted points shows many high-IBU IPAs in the 0.06–0.09 ABV band, with some beers exceeding 120 IBU. High ABV does not guarantee high IBU; stouts and quads can be strong without chasing hop extremes.</p>
<p class="art-p">The joint distribution maps the craft design space: hop-forward versus malt-forward paths to intensity.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-file-cannot-tell-you" class="anchored">What this file cannot tell you</h2>
<p class="art-p">ABV and IBU fields can be missing or rounded. Style coverage depends on which breweries entered the scrape. "Craft" definitions and the 2018 vintage miss later hard-seltzer and nonalcoholic shifts.</p>
<p class="art-p">Name-level leaders may be one-off specialty releases, not flagship year-round beers.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-take-away" class="anchored">What to take away</h2>
<p class="art-p">Across 2,410 U.S. craft beers, median ABV is 0.06 while the ceiling reaches 0.128. Most of the catalog lives near everyday strength; the high-gravity tail is short and famous.</p>
<p class="art-p">Use the ABV–IBU scatter to explain style strategy: bitterness and alcohol are correlated tools, not a single dial.</p>
